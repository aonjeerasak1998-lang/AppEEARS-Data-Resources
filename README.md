# AppEEARS-Data-Resources

Welcome to the AppEEARS-Data-Resources repository. This repository provides resources and tutorials to help users work with [AppEEARS](https://appeears.earthdatacloud.nasa.gov/) programmatically. This repository also includes notebooks showing how to access and work with AppEEARS outputs directly in the Cloud. 

> Please note that in the interest of open science this repository has been made public but is still under active development.
